This website is the host to all my games. I will try to write the same game in different languages to better my skills. I'm going to practice documentation.

Website: https://land-of-gaming.vercel.app/

Folders:

Storage: 
*Holds redux stuff
*Reuseable Modules
*My Test Files for testing random things

Storage/Redux:
*Currently not being used for anything. I optimized the website

Notes: 
-Logic: when writing logic think like a human. Think about *literally* every step to complete the task
-Design: I could be better with colors, haha
-Bugs: don't put everything inside of state

Games Planned: KnuckleBones(current working on), tick tac toe, rock paper scissors, hangman
