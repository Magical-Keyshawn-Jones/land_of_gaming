    Notes

    1) Checks if all columns are full for either team
    2) dice roll function- determines what number is on the dice
    3) check Columns function- checks if a column is empty
        If column is empty only look at the ones that are not empty
        
        if there is a matching number insert number 
        -into that column 
        -multiply the value by 1,2, or 3
        -change the box to a pale yellow
        -then add points

        if opponent has the same number
        -place it in that column
        -destroy matching numbers on the opposite team
        -then deduct points

        else place randomly
    3) checks if all columns are full for either team 
        Announce winner, looser, or draw

    *Points: store points inside of classes
    *Grid: for now put inside of state. Try to implement it into classes
    
    + I should try to use classes for this
    + A dice function - on click changes the box to a dice number
